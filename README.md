# Kuro TradingSorter

## Overveiw
- This was a simple project meant to pharse csv data exports to html where it can nicely viusalize your trading week/year/month ect. 
The only issue is im dog shit at html and css so if you wanna fork it with a nice interface using jinjs2 go for it.

## how to run
- just do `python run.py -f /path/to/csvFile.csv` and go to 127.0.0.1:5000 or localhost:5000 in your web browser
